This is program SelectionSort.
{ Ordena cada linha de uma matriz utilizando o algoritmo Selection Sort }

It presents:
    vector of number(3x5) listaNumeros;
    alterable number I, J, K, MinIndex, Temp;

Let us begin:

    considering I from 1 to 3 by 1 do [
        considering J from 1 to 5 by 1 do [
            capture(listaNumeros(I,J))
        ];
    ];

    considering I from 1 to 3 by 1 do [
        { Aplica o SelecitonSort na linha I}
        considering J from 1 to 4 by 1 do [
            MinIndex := J;

            considering K from J + 1 to 5 by 1 do [
                just in case that (listaNumeros(I,K) < listaNumeros(I,MinIndex)) do [
                   MinIndex := K;
                ];
            ];

            just in case that (MinIndex != J) do [
                Temp := listaNumeros(I,J);
                listaNumeros(I,J) := listaNumeros(I,MinIndex);
                listaNumeros(I,MinIndex) = Temp;
            ];
            
            just in case that (listaNumeros(J,I) >= listaNumeros(MinIndex, I)) do [
                go to next iteration;
            ];
        ];
    ];

    considering I from 1 to 3 by 1 do [
        considering J from 1 to 5 by 1 do [
            show("Ordenado: ", listaNumeros(I,J));
        ];
    ];

That would be all.
